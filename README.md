# kabum-price-alert
This Flask application is a price monitoring and alert system designed to track the prices of products listed on Kabum. Users can register their emails and specify a product link and desired price. The system uses APScheduler to schedule periodic checks of the product's current price. When the price matches or falls below the user's desired threshold, an email alert is sent notifying the user that the product is available for purchase.
